# Discord Hate Speech Detection Bot

A hate speech detection bot for Discord. Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network) trained on Twitter tweets to detect hate speech. Programming language used is Python. Tweet data from various sources; see [./data/](./data/). However a bulk of the data comes from [T-Davidson](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language). (Be warned that if you do check the data, that it contains highly offensive language including racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.).
