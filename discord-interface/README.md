### Discord Interface

This is the bot source code.
It will interface with discord channel and send messages to our classification service.
The classification service will classify the messages as hate speech or not and the bot will send messages to the channel administrator regarding that behavior.

How to create a discord bot

https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html

Each member should create their own bot.  Plenty of examples on web to get this done.
MSG me (Miles) if you need any help joining bot to server.
Each bot gets a token.  Store this token locally (DO NOT PUSH TO GIT).
main.py accepts a path to a file containing the token and will start the bot.
